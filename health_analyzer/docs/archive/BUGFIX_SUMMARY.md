# Bug Fixes - Delete Report, View Report, and Create Profile

## Date: October 20, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Create Profile Functionality Not Working

**Problem**: The `ProfileFormScreen` was missing the `relationship` field, but the `ProfileViewModel.createProfile()` method expects this parameter. This caused profile creation to fail silently or with errors.

**Root Cause**:
- The Profile model has a `relationship` field
- The `ProfileViewModel.createProfile()` method accepts a `relationship` parameter
- The `ProfileFormScreen` UI did not include the relationship dropdown
- When creating a profile, `null` was being passed for relationship, but the database expects this field

**Solution**:
Added the relationship field to `ProfileFormScreen`:
1. Added `_selectedRelationship` state variable
2. Added `_relationships` list with options: Self, Spouse, Parent, Child, Sibling, Other
3. Added relationship dropdown UI between Gender and Save button
4. Updated `_saveProfile()` to pass relationship to createProfile/updateProfile

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/views/screens/profile_form_screen.dart`
  - Line 25: Added `String? _selectedRelationship;`
  - Line 27-34: Added `_relationships` list
  - Line 42: Load existing relationship when editing
  - Line 132-152: Added relationship dropdown field
  - Line 247-248: Pass relationship when creating/updating profile

### 2. âœ… Delete Report Functionality Not Working Properly

**Problem**: After deleting a report, the report list wasn't refreshing automatically. The report appeared to still be in the list until the screen was manually reloaded.

**Root Cause**:
- The delete operation was successful in the database
- However, `loadReportsForProfile()` was not called after deletion
- The UI state was not updated to reflect the deletion

**Solution**:
Updated the delete confirmation dialog to:
1. Store a reference to the ReportViewModel
2. Call `deleteReport()` and wait for success
3. Immediately call `loadReportsForProfile()` to refresh the list
4. Show success/error message with better error handling

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/views/screens/report_list_screen.dart`
  - Line 165-187: Enhanced delete confirmation with proper reload and error handling

**Changes**:
```dart
// Before:
final success = await context.read<ReportViewModel>().deleteReport(report.id!);
if (success && context.mounted) {
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(...);
}

// After:
final viewModel = context.read<ReportViewModel>();
final success = await viewModel.deleteReport(report.id!);

if (success && mounted) {
  // Reload reports for the profile after deletion
  await viewModel.loadReportsForProfile(widget.profileId);
  
  if (mounted) {
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(...);
  }
} else if (mounted) {
  // Show error message
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
    SnackBar(
      content: Text(viewModel.error ?? 'Failed to delete report'),
      backgroundColor: Colors.red,
    ),
  );
}
```

### 3. âœ… View Report Functionality - Error Handling Improved

**Problem**: While the view report functionality was working, there was no error handling when loading parameters for a report detail screen.

**Solution**:
Added try-catch error handling to `_loadParameters()` method in ReportDetailScreen:
1. Wrapped parameter loading in try-catch block
2. Added debug logging for errors
3. Show error snackbar if parameter loading fails
4. Set empty parameters list instead of leaving null

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/views/screens/report_detail_screen.dart`
  - Line 39-67: Enhanced parameter loading with error handling

## How to Test

### Test 1: Create Profile
1. Open the app
2. Tap on "Profiles" tab (bottom navigation)
3. Tap the "+" button (or "Add Profile" FAB)
4. Fill in:
   - Name: "Test User"
   - Date of Birth: Select any date
   - Gender: Select "Male"
   - Relationship: Select "Self" âœ… (NEW FIELD)
5. Tap "Create Profile"
6. âœ… Profile should be created successfully with a green success message
7. âœ… You should see the new profile in the list

### Test 2: View Reports
1. From the Profiles tab, tap on any profile card
2. A bottom sheet should slide up showing profile details
3. Tap the "View Reports" button at the bottom
4. âœ… You should navigate to the Report List screen
5. âœ… If reports exist, they should be displayed
6. âœ… If no reports exist, you should see "No Reports Yet" empty state

### Test 3: Delete Report
1. Navigate to a profile's Report List (see Test 2)
2. Find a report in the list
3. Tap the three dots menu (â‹®) on the right side of the report card
4. Select "Delete" from the popup menu (shown in red)
5. A confirmation dialog should appear
6. Tap "Delete" to confirm
7. âœ… Report should be deleted
8. âœ… Green success message should appear
9. âœ… Report should immediately disappear from the list (no manual refresh needed)
10. âœ… If it was the last report, empty state should appear

### Test 4: View Report Details
1. Navigate to a profile's Report List
2. Tap on any report card (not the menu)
3. âœ… Report Detail screen should open
4. âœ… You should see:
   - Test date
   - Lab name
   - List of parameters with values
   - Status badges (Normal/High/Low)
5. âœ… If report has an image/PDF, toggle button should work
6. âœ… No errors should appear in console

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks and error messages
2. **Debug Logging**: Added `debugPrint` statements for troubleshooting
3. **State Management**: Proper use of `mounted` checks to prevent setState on unmounted widgets
4. **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages for all operations
5. **Data Consistency**: Automatic reload after delete ensures UI matches database state

---

## Database Schema Verification

The Profile table includes these fields:
- `id` - INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
- `name` - TEXT NOT NULL
- `date_of_birth` - TEXT
- `gender` - TEXT
- `relationship` - TEXT âœ… (This field was missing from the form)
- `photo_path` - TEXT
- `created_at` - TEXT NOT NULL

All fields are now properly supported in the UI.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Relationship Field**: Optional field (can be null)
2. **Date of Birth**: Optional field (can be null)
3. **Gender**: Optional field (can be null)
4. **Report Image**: If report has no image/PDF, toggle button is hidden

---

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Run the app: `flutter run`
2. Create a new profile with relationship field
3. Scan a report for the profile
4. View the report details
5. Delete the report and verify it disappears
6. Check console for any error messages
