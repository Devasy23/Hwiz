# View Report Image Fix - October 20, 2025

## Issue Reported
When clicking on "View Report Image", the app showed graphics errors and nothing was displayed:
```
E/AdrenoUtils(11011): <adreno_init_memory_layout:4689>: Memory Layout input parameter validation failed!
E/qdgralloc(11011): GetGpuResourceSizeAndDimensions Graphics metadata init failed
E/Gralloc4(11011): isSupported(1, 1, 56, 1, ...) failed with 1
E/GraphicBufferAllocator(11011): Failed to allocate (4 x 4) layerCount 1 format 56 usage b00: 1
E/AHardwareBuffer(11011): GraphicBuffer(w=4, h=4, lc=1) failed (Unknown error -1), handle=0x0
```

## Changes Made ✅

### 1. Renamed Button Tooltip (User Request)
**Before:**
- "Show Image" / "Show Data"

**After:**
- "View Report" / "View Data"

**Changed icon:**
- From: `Icons.list` / `Icons.image`
- To: `Icons.description` / `Icons.image`

This makes it clearer that users are viewing the actual report scan/document.

### 2. Enhanced Image Loading with Better Error Handling

#### Added Pre-checks:
- **File existence check** before attempting to load
- Shows user-friendly error if file doesn't exist
- Provides "View Data Instead" button as fallback

#### Added Loading Indicator:
- Shows `CircularProgressIndicator` while image is loading
- Uses `frameBuilder` to track loading progress

#### Enhanced Error Messages:
- More descriptive error display
- Shows actual error message to user
- Black background for better image contrast
- Larger, clearer error icons

#### Debug Logging:
```dart
🖼️ Building image view
  Path: /path/to/image.jpg
  Is PDF: false
  File exists: true
✅ Image loaded (frame: 1)
```

---

### 3. Enhanced PDF Loading with Better Error Handling

#### Added Pre-checks:
- **File existence check** before attempting to load PDF
- Shows user-friendly error if PDF doesn't exist
- Provides "View Data Instead" button as fallback

#### Enhanced Callbacks:
- `onDocumentLoaded`: Logs success and shows page count
- `onDocumentLoadFailed`: Detailed error logging and display
- Success message shows total pages loaded

#### Debug Logging:
```dart
📄 Building PDF view
  Path: /path/to/report.pdf
  File exists: true
✅ PDF loaded successfully
  Total pages: 3
```

---

### 4. Better User Experience

#### If Image/PDF Not Found:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   [broken_image icon]   │
│                         │
│  Report image not found │
│                         │

│                         │
│  [View Data Instead]    │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

#### If Image Fails to Load:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   [error_outline icon]  │
│                         │
│  Error loading image    │

## What Might Have Caused the Original Issue

The graphics errors you saw are **Android GPU allocation failures**. This typically happens when:

1. **Image file is corrupted or invalid format**
2. **Image is too large** for GPU to handle
3. **File path is incorrect** or file doesn't exist
4. **Android graphics driver issue**

### Our Fixes Address:
- ✅ **File existence check** - Prevents trying to load non-existent files
- ✅ **Better error handling** - Shows what went wrong instead of crashing silently
- ✅ **Fallback option** - Users can view data even if image fails
- ✅ **Loading indicator** - Shows progress while loading large files

## Known Issue Addressed

The **Android GPU errors** you encountered are typically caused by:
1. Trying to allocate a texture for an invalid/corrupted image
2. File doesn't exist but code tries to load it anyway
3. Image dimensions or format incompatible with GPU

**Our solution:**
- Check file exists BEFORE trying to load → Prevents GPU allocation attempts on invalid files
- Graceful error handling → User sees friendly message instead of crash
- Fallback to data view → User can still access report information

---

## Next Steps

1. **Hot reload** the app:
   ```
   # In the terminal where flutter run is active:
   Press 'r' (lowercase) for hot reload
   ```

2. **Test the View Report button:**
   - Try with image reports
   - Try with PDF reports
   - Check console for debug messages

3. **If still getting GPU errors:**
   - Check what format the image is saved in
   - Check if image file actually exists
   - Try scanning a new report
   - Share the console output
