## üí° Pro Tips

### Comparing Reports

2. **Post-treatment**: Compare before/after medication or lifestyle changes
3. **Multiple parameters**: Focus on related parameters (e.g., all cholesterol values)

### Exporting Data
1. **Regular backups**: Export complete profile monthly
2. **Doctor visits**: Export latest report as CSV before appointments
3. **Family sharing**: Export and share with family members' devices

### Importing Data
1. **Restore**: If you switch phones, just import your JSON backup
2. **Merge data**: Import CSV to add missing reports without duplicating profile
3. **Test imports**: Try with a small CSV first to verify format
