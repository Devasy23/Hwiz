### 2. 💾 Cached AI Analysis

**Problem Solved**: AI insights were regenerated every time, wasting API calls and time.

**Solution**:
- Added `ai_analysis` column to database (stores JSON)
- Updated `BloodReport` model to include `aiAnalysis` field
- Modified AI insights loading logic:
  - Loads cached analysis on screen open if available
  - Only generates new analysis if cache is empty
  - "Refresh" button explicitly regenerates when needed
  - Automatically saves new analysis to database

**Database Changes**:
- Added `ai_analysis TEXT` column to `reports` table
- Added `updateAiAnalysis()` method to DatabaseHelper

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Faster report viewing (instant AI insights)
- ✅ Reduced API costs (no repeated calls)
- ✅ Works offline (cached insights available)
- ✅ User control (manual refresh when desired)

**Usage**:
- Open report → AI analysis loads instantly from cache
- Tap refresh icon to regenerate with latest AI insights

- First time viewing report → generates and caches AI analysis
- Subsequent views → uses cached analysis
